# Hi there, I'm mikenu! 👋

🇯🇵 **Pop!_OS / COSMIC DE** Japanese Localization Contributor.
I am focused on making the desktop experience better through high-quality localization.

---

## 🚀 My Current Focus

I primarily **contribute to the Japanese Localization (L10n)** efforts for **COSMIC DE** and the Pop!\_OS ecosystem. My work is driven by the goal of achieving **Better UI/UX** for Japanese users worldwide.

My translations are pushed to the core System76 repositories **via Weblate**, where they are submitted as Pull Requests.

## ✨ Achievements and Impact

* **Project Scope:** My contributions are recognized across the **majority of the core Pop!\_OS and COSMIC DE repositories** (e.g., **`cosmic-files`**, **`cosmic-text`**), due to the system-wide nature of localization.
* **Collaboration:** Proud recipient of the **Pair Extraordinaire** achievement, earned through my dedicated workflow with the Weblate automation system.
* **Concentration:** I maintain a deep focus on key user components, including `cosmic-files`, `cosmic-text` (merged PRs), `cosmic-term`, and `cosmic-edit`.
