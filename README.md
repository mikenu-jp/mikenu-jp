# Hi there, I'm mikenu! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ **Linux Desktop User (10+ Years)** and **Pop!_OS / COSMIC DE** Japanese Localization Contributor.
I am focused on making the desktop experience better through high-quality localization.

## ðŸš€ My Current Focus

I primarily **contribute to the Japanese Localization (L10n)** efforts for **COSMIC DE** and the Pop!\_OS ecosystem. I also actively test the latest releases, such as the **Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta in QEMU**, to ensure a high-quality UI/UX.

My firsthand impressions from the Beta confirm the **remarkable speed** of the Rust-based applications (Terminal, Files, Editor), highlighting the immense potential of the COSMIC DE development.

My translations are pushed to the core System76 repositories **via Weblate**, where they are submitted as Pull Requests.

## âœ¨ Achievements and Impact

* **Project Scope:** My contributions are recognized across the **majority of the core Pop!_OS and COSMIC DE repositories** (e.g., **`cosmic-files`**, **`cosmic-text`**), due to the system-wide nature of localization.
* **Collaboration:** Proud recipient of the **Pair Extraordinaire** achievement, earned through my dedicated workflow with the Weblate automation system.
* **Concentration:** I maintain a deep focus on key user components, including `cosmic-files`, `cosmic-text` (merged PRs), `cosmic-term`, and `cosmic-edit`.
